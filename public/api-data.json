COPS links to your Calibre library database and allows downloading and emailing of books directly from a web browser and provides a OPDS feed to connect to your devices.  Changes in your Calibre library are reflected immediately in your COPS pages.  See : [COPS's home] for more details.  Don't forget to check the [Wiki](https://github.com/mikespub-org/seblucas-cops/wiki).  ## Why? (taken from the author's site)  In my opinion Calibre is a marvelous tool but is too big and has too much dependencies to be used for its content server.  That's the main reason why I coded this OPDS server. I needed a simple tool to be installed on a small server (Seagate Dockstar in my case).  I initially thought of Calibre2OPDS but as it generate static file no search was possible.  Later I added an simple HTML catalog that should be usable on my Kobo.  So COPS's main advantages are :  * No need for many dependencies.  * No need for a lot of CPU or RAM.  * Not much code.  * Search is available.  * With Dropbox / owncloud it's very easy to have an up to date OPDS server.  * It was fun to code.  If you want to use the OPDS feed don't forget to specify /feed at the end of your URL.","version":"3.6.5-ls268","version_timestamp":"2025-08-24 21:02:08+00:00","category":"Books","stable":true,"deprecated":false,"stars":43,"monthly_pulls":4514,"tags":[{"tag":"latest","desc":"Stable releases"}],"architectures":[{"arch":"x86_64","tag":"amd64-latest"},{"arch":"arm64","tag":"arm64v8-latest"}],"changelog":[{"date":"2025-07-10","desc":"Rebase to Alpine 3.22."},{"date":"2025-05-14","desc":"Existing users should verify: site-confs/default.conf and config/local.php - Clean-up default site conf and local.php."},{"date":"2024-12-16","desc":"Rebase to Alpine 3.21."}],"config":{"application_setup":"https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-cops?tab=readme-ov-file#application-setup","env_vars":[{"name":"PUID","value":"1000","desc":"User ID","optional":false},{"name":"PGID","value":"1000","desc":"Group ID","optional":false},{"name":"TZ","value":"Etc/UTC","desc":"Timezone","optional":false}],"volumes":[{"path":"/config","host_path":"/path/to/cops/config","desc":"COPS Application Data.","optional":false},{"path":"/books","host_path":"/path/to/data","desc":"Calibre metadata.db location.","optional":false}],"ports":[{"external":"80","internal":"80","desc":"HTTP WebUI","optional":false},{"external":"443","internal":"443","desc":"HTTPS WebUI","optional":false}]}},{"name":"cura","initial_date":"2023-11-15","github_url":"https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-cura","project_url":"https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/","project_logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxserver/docker-templates/master/linuxserver.io/img/cura-logo.png","description":"[UltiMaker Cura] is free, easy-to-use 3D printing software trusted by millions of users.
